  - justify-content: The difference between `space-evenly` and `space-around` is that in `space-around`,
                     the spacing between the elements is equal, but the distance after the last element
                     and before the first element is half the distance between the elements.
                     However, in `space-evenly`, all distances are equal between the elements,
                     and the distance after the last element and before the first element is also
                     the same as the distance between the elements.
